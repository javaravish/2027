    <h2>1. Generics</h2>
    <p>Generics in Java allow you to write code that works with different data types without specifying the exact type
        in advance, making your code more flexible, reusable, and type-safe. Generics were introduced in Java 5 to
        address shortcomings of pre-generic Java in handling objects, specifically regarding type safety and
        reusability.</p>

    <p><strong>Why use generics?</strong></p>
    <p>Generics offer several key advantages:</p>
    <p>- <strong>Type Safety:</strong> Generics enable the compiler to perform type checking at compile time, catching
        errors that would otherwise manifest at runtime as ClassCastException .</p>
    <p>- <strong>Code Reusability:</strong> You can write a single class, interface, or method that operates on various
        data types, reducing code duplication.</p>
    <p>- <strong>No Explicit Type Casting:</strong> Generics eliminate the need for manual type casting when retrieving
        objects, resulting in cleaner and more readable code.</p>
    <p>- <strong>Improved Code Readability and Maintainability:</strong> By specifying types explicitly, generic code
        becomes easier to understand and maintain.</p>
    <p>- <strong>Generic Algorithms:</strong> Generics enable the creation of algorithms that work across various types,
        promoting efficient coding practices.</p>

    <p><strong>How generics work</strong></p>
    <p>Generics work by using <strong>type parameters</strong>—placeholders for actual data types. These type parameters
        are defined within angle brackets &lt; &gt;. For examples of generic classes and methods, you can refer to the
        provided source documents.</p>

    <p><strong>Key concepts</strong></p>
    <p>- <strong>Type Erasure:</strong> During compilation, the Java compiler replaces generic type parameters with
        their bounds (or Object if no bounds are specified), ensuring backward compatibility but limiting runtime type
        information.</p>
    <p>- <strong>Bounded Type Parameters:</strong> You can restrict the types that can be used as type arguments using
        the extends keyword (upper bound) or super keyword (lower bound).</p>
    <p>- List&lt;? extends Number&gt;: Accepts Number or any of its subclasses (e.g., Integer, Double).</p>
    <p>- List&lt;? super Integer&gt;: Accepts Integer or any of its superclasses (e.g., Number, Object).</p>
    <p>- <strong>Wildcards:</strong> Represented by the ? symbol, wildcards can specify unknown types in situations like
        method parameters or field declarations, increasing flexibility.</p>
    <p>- List&lt;?&gt;: Represents a list of unknown type.</p>

    <p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
    <p>- Generics cannot directly work with primitive types (e.g., int, char, double); you must use their corresponding
        wrapper classes (e.e., Integer, Character, Double).</p>
    <p>- You cannot create instances of a generic type parameter (e.g., new T()).</p>
    <p>- Due to type erasure, you cannot use instanceof with parameterized types at runtime.</p>

    <p>Generics are a vital part of modern Java development, significantly improving the safety, reusability, and
        readability of your code. Understanding their principles and mastering their usage is crucial for any Java
        programmer.</p>
