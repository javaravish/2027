                <p>JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in
                    1991,&nbsp;later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It was developed
                    by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. It is a simple programming
                    language. &nbsp;Writing, compiling and debugging a program is
                    easy in java.&nbsp; It helps to create modular programs and
                    reusable code.</p>
                <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple">Introduction to
                    Java:-</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Java is a programming language
                    used for software development. It is used to develop advanced and
                    secure applications, websites, mobile applications and desktop
                    applications etc. This programming language is of high level
                    which uses the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. This
                    makes it a language that can be used for a wide variety of tasks.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Software developed by Java
                    requires a Java Virtual Machine to operate. Java virtual machine
                    is a software that systematically interprets Java code so that it
                    can run on all platforms without any problem.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In Java, source code is
                    compiled into byte code, whereas in other languages, source code
                    is compiled into machine code.</p>

                <p>4 main concepts of Object Oriented programming are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Abstraction</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation</li>
                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Polymorphism</li>
                </ol>
                <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple">Simple</h3>
                <p>
                    Java is considered as one of simple language because it does not
                    have complex features like Operator overloading, <a
                        href="https://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/java-multiple-inheritance/">Multiple
                    inheritance</a>, pointers and Explicit memory allocation.
                </p>


                <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-robust-language">Robust
                    Language</h3>


                <p>Robust means reliable. Java programming language is
                    developed in a way that puts a lot of emphasis on early checking
                    for possible errors, that’s why java compiler is able to detect
                    errors that are not easy to detect in other programming
                    languages. The main features of java that makes it robust are
                    garbage collection, Exception Handling and memory allocation.</p>


                <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secure">Secure</h3>


                <p>We don’t have pointers and we cannot access out of bound
                    arrays (you get ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if you try to do
                    so) in java. That’s why several security flaws like stack
                    corruption or buffer overflow is impossible to exploit in Java.</p>


                <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-java-is-distributed">Java
                    is distributed</h3>


                <p>Using java programming language we can create distributed
                    applications. RMI(Remote Method Invocation) and EJB(Enterprise
                    Java Beans) are used for creating distributed applications in
                    java. In simple words: The java programs can be distributed on
                    more than one systems that are connected to each other using
                    internet connection. Objects on one JVM (java virtual machine)
                    can execute procedures on a remote JVM.</p>


                <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-multithreading">Multithreading</h3>


                <p>Java supports multithreading. Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution
                    of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilisation of CPU.
                </p>


                <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-portable">Portable</h3>


                <p>As discussed above, java code that is written on one
                    machine can run on another machine. The platform independent byte
                    code can be carried to any platform for execution that makes java
                    code portable.</p>
