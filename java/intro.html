    <p>JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in
        1991,&nbsp;later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It was developed
        by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. It is a simple programming
        language. &nbsp;Writing, compiling and debugging a program is
        easy in java.&nbsp; It helps to create modular programs and
        reusable code.</p>
    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction to
        Java:-</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Java is a programming language
        used for software development. It is used to develop advanced and
        secure applications, websites, mobile applications and desktop
        applications etc. This programming language is of high level
        which uses the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. This
        makes it a language that can be used for a wide variety of tasks.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Software developed by Java
        requires a Java Virtual Machine to operate. Java virtual machine
        is a software that systematically interprets Java code so that it
        can run on all platforms without any problem.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In Java, source code is
        compiled into byte code, whereas in other languages, source code
        is compiled into machine code.</p>

    <p>4 main concepts of Object Oriented programming are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Abstraction</li>
        <li>Encapsulation</li>
        <li>Inheritance</li>
        <li>Polymorphism</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple">Simple</h3>
    <p>
        Java is considered as one of simple language because it does not
        have complex features like Operator overloading, Multiple
        inheritance, pointers and Explicit memory allocation.
    </p>

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-robust-language">Robust
        Language</h3>

    <p>Robust means reliable. Java programming language is
        developed in a way that puts a lot of emphasis on early checking
        for possible errors, that's why java compiler is able to detect
        errors that are not easy to detect in other programming
        languages. The main features of java that makes it robust are
        garbage collection, Exception Handling and memory allocation.</p>

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secure">Secure</h3>

    <p>We don't have pointers and we cannot access out of bound
        arrays (you get ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if you try to do
        so) in java. That's why several security flaws like stack
        corruption or buffer overflow is impossible to exploit in Java.</p>

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-java-is-distributed">Java
        is distributed</h3>

    <p>Using java programming language we can create distributed
        applications. RMI(Remote Method Invocation) and EJB(Enterprise
        Java Beans) are used for creating distributed applications in
        java. In simple words: The java programs can be distributed on
        more than one systems that are connected to each other using
        internet connection. Objects on one JVM (java virtual machine)
        can execute procedures on a remote JVM.</p>

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-multithreading">Multithreading</h3>

    <p>Java supports multithreading. Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution
        of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilisation of CPU.
    </p>

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-portable">Portable</h3>

    <p>As discussed above, java code that is written on one
        machine can run on another machine. The platform independent byte
        code can be carried to any platform for execution that makes java
        code portable.</p>

    <h3>Additional Content</h3>
    <p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by
        Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.</p>

    <h3>Java Versions</h3>
    <p>Java has evolved through several versions since its initial release:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>JDK 1.0 (January 1996)</li>
        <li>JDK 1.1 (February 1997)</li>
        <li>J2SE 1.2 (December 1998)</li>
        <li>J2SE 1.3 (May 2000)</li>
        <li>J2SE 1.4 (February 2002)</li>
        <li>J2SE 5.0 (September 2004)</li>
        <li>Java SE 6 (December 2006)</li>
        <li>Java SE 7 (July 2011)</li>
        <li>Java SE 8 (March 2014)</li>
        <li>Java SE 9 (September 2017)</li>
        <li>Java SE 10 (March 2018)</li>
        <li>Java SE 11 (September 2018)</li>
        <li>Java SE 12 (March 2019)</li>
        <li>Java SE 13 (September 2019)</li>
        <li>Java SE 14 (March 2020)</li>
        <li>Java SE 15 (September 2020)</li>
        <li>Java SE 16 (March 2021)</li>
        <li>Java SE 17 (September 2021)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Java Platforms</h3>
    <p>There are four platforms of the Java programming language:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE)</li>
        <li>Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)</li>
        <li>Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME)</li>
        <li>JavaFX</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Java Virtual Machine</h3>
    <p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs. The
        JVM has two primary functions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To allow Java programs to run on any device or operating system (known as the "Write once, run
            anywhere" principle).
        </li>
        <li>To manage and optimize program memory.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Java Development Kit</h3>
    <p>The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java
        applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader
        (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools
        needed in Java development.</p>

    <h3>Java Runtime Environment</h3>
    <p>The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine, and other
        components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming language.</p>
