    <h3>1. Introduction to Microservices</h3>
    <div>Microservices are a software architectural style in which a large
        application is built as a collection of small, independent services that
        communicate with each other over a network.&nbsp;
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>Each service is a
        self-contained unit of functionality that can be developed, tested, and
        deployed independently of the other services. This allows for more
        flexibility and scalability than a monolithic architecture, where all
        the functionality is contained in a single, large codebase.&nbsp;
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>Microservices can be written in different programming languages and use
        different technologies, as long as they can communicate with each other
        through a common API.&nbsp;
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>They are designed to be loosely coupled, meaning
        that changes to one service should not affect the other services. This
        makes it easier to update, maintain, and scale the application.
        Microservices architecture is best suited for large and complex
        applications that need to handle a high volume of traffic and need to be
        scaled horizontally.
    </div>
    <h3>2. Why Microservices</h3>
    <ul><span>
							</span>
        <li><strong>Agility and speed:</strong><span>
									Develop,</span><span> deploy,</span><span> and update individual services
									independently,</span><span> increasing development speed and responsiveness to
									changing needs.</span></li>
        <span>
							</span>
        <li><strong>Scalability and resilience:</strong><span> Each
									service can scale independently based on demand,</span><span> improving overall
									application resilience and handling failures gracefully.</span></li>
        <span>
							</span>
        <li><strong>Maintainability and flexibility:</strong><span>
									Independent services make it easier to understand,</span><span>
									debug,</span><span> and update code,</span><span> reducing complexity and
									increasing collaboration.</span></li>
        <span>
							</span>
        <li><strong>Technology choice freedom:</strong><span> Choose
									different languages and technologies for different services based on their
									specific needs.</span></li>
        <span>
							</span>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. When To Use</h3>
    <ul><span>
							</span>
        <li><strong>Complex and evolving
            applications:</strong><span> Microservices excel when large,</span><span>
									intricate applications need continuous updates and flexibility.</span></li>
        <span>
							</span>
        <li><strong>Need for fast deployment and
            updates:</strong><span> Frequent releases and adaptations are easier with
									independent services.</span></li>
        <span>
							</span>
        <li><strong>High scalability and resilience:</strong><span>
									When handling massive traffic or expecting failures,</span><span> microservices
									provide better fault tolerance.</span></li>
        <span>
							</span>
        <li><strong>Multilingual development team:</strong><span>
									Different teams can work on separate services with their preferred
									technologies.</span></li>
        <span>
							</span>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Key Components of a Microservices Architecture</h3>
    <p>Key components of a microservices architecture include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><b>Core Services</b>: Each service is a self-contained unit of functionality
                that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently of the other
                services.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Service registry</b>: A service registry is a database of all the services
                in the system, along with their locations and capabilities. It allows
                services to discover and communicate with each other.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>API Gateway:</b> An API gateway is a single entry point for all incoming
                requests to the microservices. It acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests
                to the appropriate service and handling tasks such as authentication and
                rate limiting.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Message bus:</b> A message bus is a messaging system that allows services
                to communicate asynchronously with each other. This can be done through
                protocols like HTTP, RabbitMQ, or Kafka.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Monitoring and logging:</b> Monitoring and logging are necessary to track
                the health of the services and troubleshoot problems.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Service discovery and load balancing:</b> This component is responsible
                for discovering service instances and directing traffic to the appropriate
                service instances based on load and availability.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD): </b>To make the
                development and deployment process of microservices as smooth as possible,
                it is recommended to use a tool such as Jenkins, TravisCI, or CircleCI to
                automate the process of building, testing, and deploying microservices.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
